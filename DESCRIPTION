Description: This package compiles statistical tools for consolidating multiple 
    significance rankings from multi-omic association studies into consensus gene rankings. 
    It compares Fisherâ€™s method and the sum of squared z-statistics (SSz), 
    to the recently developed cellwise Minimum Covariance Determinant (cellMCD) approach 
    for gene prioritization. Functions are provided for diagnostics, evaluate 
    performance in simulations, and generate visualizations for the three methods.
