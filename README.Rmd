**Consensus gene ranking from multi-omic association studies using Fisher, SSz, and cwMCD**

## Installation

You can install the development version of momaz with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("doraaobodo/momaz")
```
## Description
The \code{momaz} package implements and compares three statistical approaches for consolidating significance rankings from multi-omic association studies into consensus gene rankings:

- **Fisher’s method**  
- **Sum of squared z-statistics (SSz)**  
- **Cellwise Minimum Covariance Determinant (cellMCD)**  

The package includes functions to compute diagnostics, evaluate method performance in simulations, and generate visualizations such as bivariate scatterplots, uniform QQ plots, and ranked heatmaps.
